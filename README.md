# Python-module

This repository contains two Python modules designed to provide basic utility functions in mathematics and string manipulation, along with a test script to demonstrate their usage.

## Modules

### Calculator Module (`calculator.py`)

The `calculator.py` module provides a class `Calculator` that includes methods for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It includes error handling for division by zero.

### String Manipulation Module (`string_utils.py`)

The `string_utils.py` module provides a class `StringUtils` that offers methods for reversing strings, converting strings to uppercase, checking if a string is a palindrome, counting vowels, and checking for special characters in strings.

## Test Script (`test.py`)

The `test.py` script demonstrates how to use both modules. It performs several operations using the `Calculator` and `StringUtils` classes and prints the results.

## Running the Tests

To run the test script, you can use the following command from the terminal:

```bash
python test.py
